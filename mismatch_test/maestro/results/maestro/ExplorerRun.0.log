Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
FA24SP25Analog_mismatch_test_1	Nominal - 
	intersect(VT("/VOUTN") VT("/VINP")):	Yield	100%
		Min 0.854399	Max 0.95774	Mean 0.902303	Number of errors 0

FA24SP25Analog_mismatch_test_1
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	200	Total number of points	200

Estimated yield = 100% (200/200), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (200/200)
